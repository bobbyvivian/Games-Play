| Challenge 1|
|------|
|It is important to see how the mesh SkyCarComponents has two materials. That's because certain parts of the geometry will be painted with one material and others with the other.|

| Challenges 2 and 3|
|------|
|To make the snow of the mountains you have to use a texture in white to paint them. The good thing about the flexibility of the terrain is that it allows to create things like the small island in the lake in the image, populated by palm trees.

| Challenges 5|
|------|
|It is important that each of the GameObjects that will mark the waypoints is located at the key turning points of the line; the more we have, the more precision we will have. It is also important that they are on the road.|

| Challenges 6|
|------|
|Here you really have a lot of freedom to generate all kinds of behaviors. But the key values would be the following:
Maximum speed.
Torque (speed applied in each cycle).
Brake torque (the same, but braking).
If it turns before, brakes before or after, etc.
If it usually brakes or never brakes.
Mass and grip on rigidbody.|
