**Introduction**

In this module we will start designing games in 3D. The structure of the module will follow the previous ones and we will divide it into two parts, a more theoretical one and another where you can practice what you have learned. In the theoretical part we will explore Unity's powerful Terrain tool, which will help us simplify the creation
of scenarios and make our games look more professional. We can create mountainous surfaces, trees, areas of grass or rocks, and even make these move with the wind.

As it is a fully 3D game, we will delve into concepts already known as the Unity cameras or camera-related components and physics, such as colliders or triggers, but always from a 3D perspective. In the practical part, we will make a simple racing game in which we can drive around a circuit with realistic physics and compete against other cars. And thanks to the fact that we will work with several assets predefined in Unity packages, we can have functionalities of advanced tools already implemented that save a lot of work for those who are getting started in Unity and in videogame programming in general.

Finally, we will learn how to customize our own scripts, with which we will adapt the Unity environment to our needs with the help of gizmos or by creating our own Inspector. This last part is really useful since the creation of custom tools is very common within the professional development workflow.
