## <ins> FPS Game: </ins>
### Details:
- Run on Unity ver. 2022.3.10f1
### Storyline:
- You're taking a relaxing getaway in this camp site / quaint town when all of a sudden, there's a strange alien invasion. They've invaded the site, blocked off all the roads, and have taken over the main tent. It's up to you to kill ALL the aliens to bring back peace upon the camp site.
### Points Implemented:
- Mountainous and nature terrain with urban componenets like houses. Closed environment within a tent you need a key to get into.
- The player has two types of weapons, a pistol and a shotgon. 
- Player has a life bar and a shield bar. When they are shot, the shield takes most of the damage, but the player will still lose a little life. When the shield reaches 0, then the health will take 100% of the damage.
- Both the amount of life, shield, type of weapon and ammunition are seen on the screen (HUD).
- The tent doors cannot be opened until the player has the appropriate key (orb).
- There are strange aliens patrolling the scene and if they see you they will start shooting at you. If you pass by them but they have not seen you (pretending that they have heard your steps), they turn looking for you.
- The game is fully sound-tracked with things like background music, walking, shooting, damage, jump, fall, etc.
- The game has a game over screen and when you die you can restart the level.
